# ES-DE Vita3K Shortcuts

A set of batch scripts to automatically generate and organise `.psvita` shortcut files for launching PS Vita games directly into [Vita3K](https://vita3k.org/) via [ES-DE](https://es-de.org/).

---

## What Are These Shortcuts?

ES-DE supports custom file extensions to launch emulators. The `.psvita` files generated by these scripts act as shortcuts that tell ES-DE which game to launch in Vita3K. Each file contains only the game's title ID (e.g. `PCSB01208`), which Vita3K uses to identify and boot the correct game.

---

## Requirements

- [ES-DE](https://es-de.org/) configured with Vita3K as an emulator
- [Vita3K](https://vita3k.org/) installed with your games already installed inside it

---

## Workflow Summary

1. Download the zip file and extract it
2. Copy the relevant shortcuts to your psvita folder in your ROMs folder.
3. Rescan the ROMs directoy in ES-DE (or force close and restart ES-DE, it does a scan on start-up!)
